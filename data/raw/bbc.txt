John Lennon: 'If we got in the studio together and turned each other on again, then it would be worth it'

** text **
Mark Chapman was there waiting for him, holding a copy of JD Salinger's novel Catcher in the Rye and the LP that Lennon had signed for him hours earlier. As the musician walked past him, Chapman pulled out a handgun, and fired multiple times into his back.

The senselessness of the murder sent shockwaves of disbelief around the world. It is difficult to overstate the profound effect The Beatles had as a cultural phenomenon, and what they meant to people. They weren't merely pop stars. They changed the landscape of popular music. Their experiments with music, film, fashion, drugs and religion had been at the forefront of the 1960s, when the world seemed to be going through seismic changes. Their music had soundtracked a whole generation of people's lives, helping them to connect to what was going on around them and to each other.

Following the shooting, grief-stricken fans flocked to the Dakota building to leave flowers and cards. For days, radio stations played nothing but The Beatles and John Lennon songs. In his hometown of Liverpool, 30,000 people gathered to hold a 10-minute silence, as did more than 225,000 in Central Park, close to where he was shot dead.

A deeper significance

His music, which had meant so much to people during his life, took on an even deeper significance after his death. In the UK, the song (Just Like) Starting Over from the Double Fantasy album went to number one in the charts, only to be quickly knocked off the top spot by 1971's Imagine, which in turn was followed by Woman. His last record became a worldwide hit, and went on to win a Grammy for album of the year.

In the decades since, the one question that has haunted fans is this: if Lennon hadn't been killed that day, would the Beatles have eventually got back together to make more music?

Cardiff's homeless community grieving death of friend Published 50 minutes ago

Image source, Reach PLC Image caption, Richard O'Brien, nicknamed Paddy or sometimes Limerick because of his Irish roots, became unwell while sleeping in a doorway

Paddy was a well-known character on the streets of Cardiff, and friends remember a nice man who liked to dance and share a drink.

Last week he became the third rough-sleeper to die in the city this year.

Richard O'Brien, nicknamed Paddy or sometimes Limerick because of his Irish roots, became unwell while sleeping in a doorway on one of the city's main shopping streets on 27 November.

As temperatures drop, one charity warned the city's hostels were full and housing waiting lists were "absolutely unprecedented".

Gary Mason said he was with 53-year-old Paddy when he became unwell and raised the alarm.

"He woke me up and said 'Ga, I can't move'," said Gary.

Image caption, A tribute to Paddy was on Queen Street for several days after his death

"He was in the doorway of Burger King with a skinny sheet over him and he didn't look well.

"I tried to warm him up, I thought he'd bounce back but he didn't."

South Wales Police confirmed a man had died after an ambulance was called to Queen Street during the early hours.

It said there were no suspicious circumstances, inquiries were being made to trace next of kin and his body had not yet been formally identified.

His friends said Paddy was a drinker but didn't use drugs and they believed he had a daughter.

Jonathan Morgan, who himself became homeless after being made redundant and a relationship breakdown, said Paddy had been sleeping rough for years.

"He was a funny little thing, he used to make you giggle, he was a nice person, a really nice man," he said.

Paddy was one of more than at least 40 people known to be sleeping rough in the city and the third rough sleeper to die in the city this year, according to Cardiff council.

Image caption, Paddy's friends said he liked to dance and would always share his drink if others were short

It said it was "very saddened to hear of the death of someone who had been rough sleeping in the city and our thoughts are with all those close to him at this sad time".

It said the person had been known to its homeless outreach team and had accessed accommodation on a number of occasions "but unfortunately each time returned to the street".

"The circumstances of this sad loss will now be investigated to see if there are any lessons that can be learned," it said.

Paddy was also known to the outreach teams at charity The Wallich.

"It's always absolutely devastating when somebody loses their life to homelessness, mainly because it's so avoidable," said its chief executive Dr Lindsay Cordery-Bruce.

The charity is currently supporting between 50 and 60 people rough sleepers in Cardiff, eight of whom sleep in tents.

She said people needed to remember that homeless people were "actually just people".

"They're someone's mum, someone's daughter, someone's son," she said.

Image caption, Gary Mason was sleeping rough with Paddy when he became unwell

She said the demand on homeless services in the city meant a lot of its emergency homeless accommodation were currently full and waiting lists for housing were "absolutely unprecedented".

She said the cost of living crisis meant the face of homelessness was changing.

"More recently we're starting to see people who are in work sleeping in cars and not able to to find accommodation - this is kind of new territory," she said.

"We used to see it every now and again before but just lately, since the cost of living crisis has started biting, we're seeing it a lot more often and that's a really big concern."

Dr Cordery-Bruce said the cause of homelessness was complex, which makes it difficult to solve.

"It comes down to the fact that we don't have enough homes for people but it's not all about houses - sometimes it's about the trauma and things that people have been through and so it's a lot more complicated that just giving somebody some keys," she said.

She would like to see controlled rent in Wales and housing benefits that match the price of rent.

The Welsh government said the latest death was "an extremely sad incident".

It said it had put in place new regulations and additional funding.

Dr Cordery-Bruce believes many people who see homeless people out in the cold "walk by because it's painful and because people don't know what to do".

What can you do to help a homeless person?

"Ask somebody if they're alright if it feels safe to do so," advised Dr Cordery-Bruce.

"Just strike up a conversation with somebody on the streets - they're usually really pleased to chat."

What should you give a homeless person?

Dr Cordery-Bruce said the key thing is to ask the homeless person what they need.

"They might have been bought 10 hot chocolates already," she said.

"They might need hand cream if the skin on their knuckles has dried out and started to split and has become painful... it might be a dry pair of socks."

Image caption, Paddy's friends say they are still in shock after his death

Should you give cash to a homeless person?

Dr Cordery-Bruce said giving money was a big debate in the homelessness sector.

"Our position at The Wallich is if you want to give money it's yours to give but do so without condition," she said.

"So if it does feel appropriate to give somebody some money so that they can choose what they spend it on, then do so without any other stipulations."

What can you do if you're not comfortable approaching a homeless person?

Street Link is a website where you can report a sighting of somebody that you're concerned about.

An outreach team is then alerted so they can go out and check on the person.

How can you spot hypothermia in a rough sleeper?

If you spot symptoms of hypothermia you should call 999 and stay with the person until help arrives.

According to the NHS, symptoms of hypothermia include shivering, skin that is pale, cold and dry, lips that have turned blue or grey, slurred speech, low breathing, tiredness or confusion.

While waiting for help you should move them indoors, remove any wet clothing, wrap them in a blanket, sleeping bag or dry towel making sure their head is covered, give them a warm non-alcoholic drink and some sugary food like chocolate if they're fully awake and keep them awake by talking to them.

What are the council doing?

Cardiff council said it had sourced additional emergency accommodation for the winter to help people to come inside off the street.

It said its outreach team would continue to support individuals sleeping outside, highlighting the dangers of sleeping rough, particularly in cold weather and encouraging them to accept accommodation.

Israel-Gaza latest news: Israel orders Gaza civilians away from 'difficult' battle in southern city

** text **
This morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin – with Netanyahu saying he wasnt satisfied with Moscows position on the war in Gaza.

Russia backed a resolution to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza at the UN Security Council on Friday.

During the phone call, Netanyahu criticised the dangerous cooperation between Russia and Iran, and said that any other country which suffered an attack equivalent to the one Israel suffered on 7 October would have reacted with at least the same force.

The Israeli prime minister relayed his appreciation for Moscow's efforts to free Russian dual nationals being held hostage in Gaza.

The Kremlin says Russia is ready to give all possible assistance to de-escalate the conflict, and that Putin reaffirmed the principle position of rejecting and condemning terrorism in all its forms. "

Explosion and fireball seen as storm sweeps through Tennessee

** text **
A funnel cloud moving over Madison, a suburb in Tennessee, caused electrical flashes and a small explosion seen in a video shared on social media.

Parts of Tennessee were hit by tornadoes and severe storms on Saturday, and at least six people died as a result.

Buildings were reduced to rubble and communities were plunged into blackouts in the southern US state.

A funnel cloud differs from a tornado in that it doesn't touch the ground. The weather phenomenon has also been described as a "baby tornado beginning to form but never quite getting there", according to BBC meteorologist David Braine.

The coloured stripes that explain climate change

** text **
Cycling 4 Climate, a foundation that has organised rides in six countries to promote climate change awareness, chose the stripe pattern as a uniform because of the strong message it conveys.

"It gives me the feeling that even when I'm exercising, I'm working on increasing climate change awareness," says co-founder Joost Brinkman, based in the Netherlands. "I frequently get asked about the shirt because people like the design. It's an easy conversation starter and people are always shocked when they understand the story."

Unlike traditional data visualisations, the blankets pattern only features colours – and resembles a barcode more than a normal graph. "Some people switch off as soon as they see a graph, right?" says Highwood. In her blog, she shared instructions to replicate the blanket using yarn or other materials. "The craft version does something different. If you are physically reproducing the pattern, you are internalising the data, and there's more chance you'll feel that it's real."

When Ed Hawkings, climate scientist and professor at the same university, saw the climate stripes and witnessed people's reactions, he thought they would be a good way to visualise the data from climate change online. He reduced the range of colours to tones of blues and reds, universally associated in weather maps with temperature.

ArChan Chan's Sweet-soy chicken wings from Hong Kong

** text **
In Hong Kong, there is no shortage of good chicken wing spots, from Taiwanese fried wings at snack stands and Korean fried chicken joints to all-you-can-eat Buffalo wings at American restaurants.

Out of all the options, however, Swiss chicken wings are one of the most popular choices, available at cha chaan tengs – Hong Kong's version of cafes or diners.

<p><a href="#Swiss Chicken Wings recipe">[jump to recipe]</a></p>

Swiss chicken wings are usually poached in water then cooked in soy sauce, sugar and spices until the wings have turned a reddish hue. When done cooking, the juicy wings are coated in a glossy, caramelised sweet-soy sauce.

But don't let the name of the chicken dish fool you, these wings are not remotely related to Switzerland, nor did the Swiss influence the recipe in the slightest.

"While no one is quite certain where Swiss chicken wings originated, rumour is that it was a classic case of translation gone wrong," said ArChan Chan, executive chef of Ho Lee Fook, a creative Chinese restaurant in Hong Kong. She is also the author of Hong Kong Local: Cult Recipes from the Streets that Make the City.

The story of how the dish gained its name varies slightly. Some say a Westerner tried the dish and exclaimed at its sweetness to the waiter, but the word "sweet" was misinterpreted as "Swiss" due to the language barrier. The waiter then assumed that the chef had made an Alpine speciality and went on to call them Swiss wings. In another version of the story, the tourist asked the waiter what the dish was, and the waiter answered, "sweet wing". The Westerner misheard it as "Swiss wing", and the name stuck.

Israel-Gaza latest news: Israel orders Gaza civilians away from 'difficult' battle in southern city

** text **
This morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin – with Netanyahu saying he wasnt satisfied with Moscows position on the war in Gaza.

Russia backed a resolution to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza at the UN Security Council on Friday.

During the phone call, Netanyahu criticised the dangerous cooperation between Russia and Iran, and said that any other country which suffered an attack equivalent to the one Israel suffered on 7 October would have reacted with at least the same force.

The Israeli prime minister relayed his appreciation for Moscow's efforts to free Russian dual nationals being held hostage in Gaza.

The Kremlin says Russia is ready to give all possible assistance to de-escalate the conflict, and that Putin reaffirmed the principle position of rejecting and condemning terrorism in all its forms. "

Eight things we learned from Shirley Ballas's Desert Island Discs

** text **
1. After every Strictly show, Shirleys mum makes her explain her judgements and comments

Shirleys mum is a keen Strictly fan – and like every viewer, she has her own opinions about the dancers, as Shirley reveals: She sits there in her little armchair watching… and when I get home on a Saturday evening at midnight, shes there with her arms folded, looking at me: Now I thought so and so and so and so, and you marked so and so and so, and so explain to me so I can understand.

As I stood there with that trophy, I was empty. There was something in my life that was missing

Shirley says that she always points out that the judges see much more than the viewers at home: When you're watching the programme, you might see from the waist upwards or overhead shots. When I'm in the studio I can see all the feet - so we are watching different things… I sometimes have to watch a heel lead that is unacceptable, [so] I have to get up and show my mother Well, I saw this... and she says Well then I guess you know best!

2. Her first disc takes her back to her first appearance on Strictly

When Shirley joined Strictly, the executive producer wanted her to make a big impact from the very first moment she appeared on the screen:

I remember her saying to me, recounts Shirley, I think we're going to have to put you in a Latin dress, Shirley, and a pair of high heels, and you're going to have to get there and do the samba!

I just looked at her and said, I haven't had a pair of shoes on since 1995. I don't even know if I can still balance in them.

She said, Youve just got to trust me. So I did! I walked around in the high heels – hardest thing I ever did – in a beautiful red dress that wardrobe had made for me. I was very, very nervous. And I remember perspiring and it was running down my back and my knees were shaking, but somehow the minute the lights go on: Lights, camera action, music! and off I went.

Shirley danced to Get Lucky, written and performed by French electronic duo Daft Punk featuring American musicians Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers, and its her first choice for the desert island. You can see Shirleys samba on the BBC Strictly Come Dancing YouTube channel.

3. Shirleys mum worked very hard to pay for dance classes and more

After her first glimpse of ballroom dancing at the age of seven, Shirley soon became a keen competitive dancer, and needed lessons and the right shoes and clothes. To pay for all this, her mother – who was raising Shirley and her brother David on her own – took a wide range of different jobs. She used to work at Cadburys on the cakes, but she'd get a couple of pounds more if she qualified as a forklift truck driver. Now she's five feet tall, barely weighs seven stone, and I thought shes never going to get that job. And boy oh boy, she qualified for that job.

I remember her being a bunny girl, I remember her making sales, babysitting, working in nightclubs. I mean, she did everything she could to give me an opportunity to be able to dance. And for that, Ill always be grateful… I never lost a little skirt or a top because I knew my mum worked so hard to get those.

And her mum inspires her second choice for the desert island: When my mum was a young girl, this was her favourite song. When she was working in night clubs and it came on, she would stop serving the drinks and dance with her best friend, Mavis. The two of them love this song.

The song is Johnny Cashs Ring of Fire.

4. By the age of 23 Shirley was a champion - but it wasnt enough

Dance dominated Shirleys teenage years, with countless hours of practice: she moved away from home and her mother at the age 14 so that she could rehearse more with her dance partner.

And after a switch of dance partners, in 1983 Shirley and her partner won the British Open to the World Professional Latin Championships and were ranked number one in the world the next year - but success wasnt all that shed hoped it would be.

As I stood there with that trophy, I was empty, says Shirley. There was something in my life that was missing and I didn't know what it was... I started to complain a little bit more with Sammy [Stopford, her dance partner and husband], but didn't really know what I was complaining about. But there was something missing in my life.

Sammy and Shirley had married when Shirley was 19 and it was as much a marriage centred on their shared passion for dance rather than necessarily for each other.

I cared about Sammy a lot. We had grown up together to be these top professionals but I think that I missed fun! Going out, having a holiday, meals out, laughter – even though I had a solid partner, one that would never cheat on me, one that would be there for me. He was that kind of character, but something in the passion department was definitely missing...

St Mirren 2-0 Ross County: What the manager said

Image source, SNS

Ross County manager Derek Adams told BBC Scotland: "I think St Mirren got the better of us. We scored an own goal to start with. We did not defend well enough at the second goal. We probably had some good play in the first half when we could've scored, but in saying that, St Mirren could have scored as well.

"We knew it was going to be difficult today. It was about putting pressure on them and we did that at the start. We could have nicked a goal but when they got ahead, they deserved to win the game.

"We need to be better in the final third, but we also have to be better defensively at times. It wasn't like St Mirren opened us up, they had some good opportunities - but you're going to have that as the home team. I thought we played, at times, well. But we have to do a lot better at the simple things."

Can cooking with an air fryer save you money?

** text **
Because an air fryer's fan is more powerful and the compartment is smaller, the whole device is more efficient, says Jakub. "If I have a chicken thigh, I will probably cook it for 20 minutes in an air fryer. In an oven it would take longer." Also, it takes longer to pre-heat a larger, conventional oven.

Because an air fryer's fan is more powerful and the compartment is smaller, the whole device is more efficient. Dr Jakub Radzikowski, Imperial College London

However, because the drawer in an air fryer has less capacity, you can only cook smaller amounts. "If you're cooking for four people or six people the kind of time saving doesn't work anymore because you have to cook in a few batches in the air fryer," says the food scientist.

3. An air fryer is great for 'crispy' foods

Marketing images for air fryers often feature chicken and chips. This is because theyre great for cooking "anything that you want crispy", says Jakub. Kale chips, banana chips, panko courgettes, you name it. His favourite food for the air fryer is chicken legs or thighs: after 20 minutes you get something that's "perfectly juicy inside" with a skin that is so crispy it "shatters like glass".

4. It's healthier than deep-fat frying

"Compared to deep-fat frying it is obviously healthier because it has lower fat content," says Jakub. But it can also be healthier than cooking with a conventional oven. If your potatoes are sitting in oil then they will absorb it as they cook. With the air fryer its all in the perforated basket: "If there is any excess fat it will drip to the bottom and you don't have to eat it."

There remain healthier ways to cook but "the perk of an air fryer is that it often has additional functions to the air frying function," says Anya Gilbert, senior digital reviews writer at BBC Good Food Magazine. You can often grill or steam instead, both without using oil at all.

5. There's a huge range of prices and functions between models

The range of different air fryers on the market is vast. "Theyre getting more and more versatile as well," says Anya. "Some of the newest models from brands like Ninja have about 15 functions."

BBC Good Food Magazine recently published its 14 best air fryers of 2022, rating models across a whole range of categories. "Cosori as a brand came out really well as best value standard size but also best for affordability in general," says Anya. Their 4.3 litre model retails at £79. However, it's possible to spend a whole lot more. "The Ninja Foodi MAX Health Grill & Air Fryer was a really highly rated model, says Anya. "It's around £249, but it has a few bells and whistles. For example, an integrated meat thermometer."

The missing airmen are now the stuff of legend. "These Hump men fight the Japanese, the jungle, the mountains and the monsoons all day and all night, every day and every night the year round. The only world they know is planes. They never stop hearing them, flying them, patching them, cursing them. Yet they never get tired of watching the planes go out to China," recounted White.

Israel-Gaza latest news: Israel orders Gaza civilians away from 'difficult' battle in southern city

** text **
This morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin – with Netanyahu saying he wasnt satisfied with Moscows position on the war in Gaza.

Russia backed a resolution to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza at the UN Security Council on Friday.

During the phone call, Netanyahu criticised the dangerous cooperation between Russia and Iran, and said that any other country which suffered an attack equivalent to the one Israel suffered on 7 October would have reacted with at least the same force.

The Israeli prime minister relayed his appreciation for Moscow's efforts to free Russian dual nationals being held hostage in Gaza.

The Kremlin says Russia is ready to give all possible assistance to de-escalate the conflict, and that Putin reaffirmed the principle position of rejecting and condemning terrorism in all its forms. "

Explosion and fireball seen as storm sweeps through Tennessee

** text **
A funnel cloud moving over Madison, a suburb in Tennessee, caused electrical flashes and a small explosion seen in a video shared on social media.

Parts of Tennessee were hit by tornadoes and severe storms on Saturday, and at least six people died as a result.

Buildings were reduced to rubble and communities were plunged into blackouts in the southern US state.

A funnel cloud differs from a tornado in that it doesn't touch the ground. The weather phenomenon has also been described as a "baby tornado beginning to form but never quite getting there", according to BBC meteorologist David Braine.

Eight things we learned from Shirley Ballas's Desert Island Discs

** text **
1. After every Strictly show, Shirleys mum makes her explain her judgements and comments

Shirleys mum is a keen Strictly fan – and like every viewer, she has her own opinions about the dancers, as Shirley reveals: She sits there in her little armchair watching… and when I get home on a Saturday evening at midnight, shes there with her arms folded, looking at me: Now I thought so and so and so and so, and you marked so and so and so, and so explain to me so I can understand.

As I stood there with that trophy, I was empty. There was something in my life that was missing

Shirley says that she always points out that the judges see much more than the viewers at home: When you're watching the programme, you might see from the waist upwards or overhead shots. When I'm in the studio I can see all the feet - so we are watching different things… I sometimes have to watch a heel lead that is unacceptable, [so] I have to get up and show my mother Well, I saw this... and she says Well then I guess you know best!

2. Her first disc takes her back to her first appearance on Strictly

When Shirley joined Strictly, the executive producer wanted her to make a big impact from the very first moment she appeared on the screen:

I remember her saying to me, recounts Shirley, I think we're going to have to put you in a Latin dress, Shirley, and a pair of high heels, and you're going to have to get there and do the samba!

I just looked at her and said, I haven't had a pair of shoes on since 1995. I don't even know if I can still balance in them.

She said, Youve just got to trust me. So I did! I walked around in the high heels – hardest thing I ever did – in a beautiful red dress that wardrobe had made for me. I was very, very nervous. And I remember perspiring and it was running down my back and my knees were shaking, but somehow the minute the lights go on: Lights, camera action, music! and off I went.

Shirley danced to Get Lucky, written and performed by French electronic duo Daft Punk featuring American musicians Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers, and its her first choice for the desert island. You can see Shirleys samba on the BBC Strictly Come Dancing YouTube channel.

3. Shirleys mum worked very hard to pay for dance classes and more

After her first glimpse of ballroom dancing at the age of seven, Shirley soon became a keen competitive dancer, and needed lessons and the right shoes and clothes. To pay for all this, her mother – who was raising Shirley and her brother David on her own – took a wide range of different jobs. She used to work at Cadburys on the cakes, but she'd get a couple of pounds more if she qualified as a forklift truck driver. Now she's five feet tall, barely weighs seven stone, and I thought shes never going to get that job. And boy oh boy, she qualified for that job.

I remember her being a bunny girl, I remember her making sales, babysitting, working in nightclubs. I mean, she did everything she could to give me an opportunity to be able to dance. And for that, Ill always be grateful… I never lost a little skirt or a top because I knew my mum worked so hard to get those.

And her mum inspires her second choice for the desert island: When my mum was a young girl, this was her favourite song. When she was working in night clubs and it came on, she would stop serving the drinks and dance with her best friend, Mavis. The two of them love this song.

The song is Johnny Cashs Ring of Fire.

4. By the age of 23 Shirley was a champion - but it wasnt enough

Dance dominated Shirleys teenage years, with countless hours of practice: she moved away from home and her mother at the age 14 so that she could rehearse more with her dance partner.

And after a switch of dance partners, in 1983 Shirley and her partner won the British Open to the World Professional Latin Championships and were ranked number one in the world the next year - but success wasnt all that shed hoped it would be.

As I stood there with that trophy, I was empty, says Shirley. There was something in my life that was missing and I didn't know what it was... I started to complain a little bit more with Sammy [Stopford, her dance partner and husband], but didn't really know what I was complaining about. But there was something missing in my life.

Sammy and Shirley had married when Shirley was 19 and it was as much a marriage centred on their shared passion for dance rather than necessarily for each other.

I cared about Sammy a lot. We had grown up together to be these top professionals but I think that I missed fun! Going out, having a holiday, meals out, laughter – even though I had a solid partner, one that would never cheat on me, one that would be there for me. He was that kind of character, but something in the passion department was definitely missing...

St Mirren 2-0 Ross County: What the manager said

Image source, SNS

Ross County manager Derek Adams told BBC Scotland: "I think St Mirren got the better of us. We scored an own goal to start with. We did not defend well enough at the second goal. We probably had some good play in the first half when we could've scored, but in saying that, St Mirren could have scored as well.

"We knew it was going to be difficult today. It was about putting pressure on them and we did that at the start. We could have nicked a goal but when they got ahead, they deserved to win the game.

"We need to be better in the final third, but we also have to be better defensively at times. It wasn't like St Mirren opened us up, they had some good opportunities - but you're going to have that as the home team. I thought we played, at times, well. But we have to do a lot better at the simple things."

Can cooking with an air fryer save you money?

** text **
Because an air fryer's fan is more powerful and the compartment is smaller, the whole device is more efficient, says Jakub. "If I have a chicken thigh, I will probably cook it for 20 minutes in an air fryer. In an oven it would take longer." Also, it takes longer to pre-heat a larger, conventional oven.

Because an air fryer's fan is more powerful and the compartment is smaller, the whole device is more efficient. Dr Jakub Radzikowski, Imperial College London

However, because the drawer in an air fryer has less capacity, you can only cook smaller amounts. "If you're cooking for four people or six people the kind of time saving doesn't work anymore because you have to cook in a few batches in the air fryer," says the food scientist.

3. An air fryer is great for 'crispy' foods

Marketing images for air fryers often feature chicken and chips. This is because theyre great for cooking "anything that you want crispy", says Jakub. Kale chips, banana chips, panko courgettes, you name it. His favourite food for the air fryer is chicken legs or thighs: after 20 minutes you get something that's "perfectly juicy inside" with a skin that is so crispy it "shatters like glass".

4. It's healthier than deep-fat frying

"Compared to deep-fat frying it is obviously healthier because it has lower fat content," says Jakub. But it can also be healthier than cooking with a conventional oven. If your potatoes are sitting in oil then they will absorb it as they cook. With the air fryer its all in the perforated basket: "If there is any excess fat it will drip to the bottom and you don't have to eat it."

There remain healthier ways to cook but "the perk of an air fryer is that it often has additional functions to the air frying function," says Anya Gilbert, senior digital reviews writer at BBC Good Food Magazine. You can often grill or steam instead, both without using oil at all.

5. There's a huge range of prices and functions between models

The range of different air fryers on the market is vast. "Theyre getting more and more versatile as well," says Anya. "Some of the newest models from brands like Ninja have about 15 functions."

BBC Good Food Magazine recently published its 14 best air fryers of 2022, rating models across a whole range of categories. "Cosori as a brand came out really well as best value standard size but also best for affordability in general," says Anya. Their 4.3 litre model retails at £79. However, it's possible to spend a whole lot more. "The Ninja Foodi MAX Health Grill & Air Fryer was a really highly rated model, says Anya. "It's around £249, but it has a few bells and whistles. For example, an integrated meat thermometer."
